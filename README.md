# 01_Code_Refactor

## Description

The client has presented an already constructed webpage that is lacking in proper semantic labels that are affecting not only the accessibility but the SEO results. Sites lacking semantic structure can be a hindrance to those that have disabilities and may not only cost the business customers but could also lead to legal action for discrimination. 

<ins>The following changes were made to the index.html page that was provided:</ins>
1. All HTML divs have been updated to reflect proper semantic structure. The index.html page no longer has any divs. 
2. The title was also lacking a proper title in the head element. That has been updated to reflect a proper description of the page. 
3. There was a broken link in the nav section that has now been rectified and points to the proper id on the page. 
5. The CSS has been cleaned up and organized in logical manner. All redundancies have been consolidated. 
6. Comments have been added to the style.css file to group the elements as they appear in index.html. This allows for easier identification and navigation of the CSS file.
